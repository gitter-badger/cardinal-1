#Card Collector
This app has been a dream of mine for a long time. I'm a huge fan of card games of all types and always wanted an app that I could throw my card collections into and run reports on.

We're still in the early days of development here's the todo list.

##Todo
1. Use Gulp and NPM/Bower to manage front-end dependencies. (Remove the go-sass dependency as it does not play nice on most systems.)
- Complete search functionality.
- Complete collection management functionality
- Make the back-end API usable from any front-end that interacts with RESTful API's
- Document **EVERYTHING**
- Add Dashboards that are modular by design. (Think JIRA style gadgets.)
- Create a plugin system that supports either multiple languages or at least 1 non-go language.
- Create an easy deployment package for people wanting to just host on their own server with no compiling required.

-- TODO SUBJECT TO CHANGE AS MORE FEATURES / IDEAS ARE REQUESTED / ADDED --
